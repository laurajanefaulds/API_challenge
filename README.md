Code in WeatherPy retrieving data from the cities list was written with assistance from my tutor Kourt Bailey

Two lines of code in my linear regression function were written with assistance from the OpenAI ChatBot, those which begin with "xpos" and "ypos" and allow the r-value equation to be printed on every scatter plot with consistency

I consulted code from class activities at various points over the course of completing both assignments, most significantly during my linear regression plot in WeatherPy and while generating my hotel finder in VacationPy
